Here are some exercises to help you get hands-on practice with CSS animations and transitions. These exercises progress from basic concepts to more advanced techniques and focus on creating engaging effects that enhance user experience.

1. Basic Transitions

Exercise 1: Create a button that changes color when hovered. Use transition to make the color change smoothly over 0.3 seconds.

Exercise 2: Design a card with a hover effect that increases its size slightly. Add a transition to smoothly scale the card over 0.2 seconds.

Exercise 3: Create a link that underlines itself when hovered. Use transition to make the underline appear gradually by animating the text-decoration or by manipulating the width of a pseudo-element.

2. Transformations with Transitions

Exercise 4: Build an image gallery where each image rotates slightly when hovered. Apply transform: rotate(5deg); with a transition of 0.3 seconds.

Exercise 5: Create a navigation bar with links that slide upwards when hovered. Use transform: translateY(-5px); with a transition.

Exercise 6: Design a 3D button effect. Use transform: translateZ or perspective to make the button look like it’s pressing down or popping up when hovered, using a transition to achieve a smooth effect.

3. Hover Effects with Multiple Transitions

Exercise 7: Create a card with multiple elements (title, image, button). When you hover over the card, make each element transition differently (e.g., the image scales up, the title changes color, and the button moves slightly).

Exercise 8: Design a profile card that, when hovered, reveals a description by sliding it in from the bottom. Use transitions to slide the text smoothly into view.

Exercise 9: Build a button that changes both its color and background gradient on hover, using transitions to create a seamless color and background change.

4. Basic Keyframe Animations

Exercise 10: Create a loading spinner using CSS @keyframes. Use transform: rotate() to spin a circular element continuously.

Exercise 11: Design a bouncing ball animation using keyframes. Use transform: translateY to move a circle element up and down, simulating a bounce.

Exercise 12: Create a heartbeat animation using a scale transformation. Animate the scale to simulate a “pulsing” effect on a shape or icon.

5. Animating with Color Changes and Opacity

Exercise 13: Design a fading text effect that fades in and out continuously using opacity in keyframes. You can use @keyframes to animate the opacity from 0 to 1 and back to 0.

Exercise 14: Create a button that has a glow effect on hover. Use keyframes to change the box-shadow to make it look like the glow is pulsing.

Exercise 15: Design an alert or notification box that flashes twice on page load to grab the user’s attention, by animating its background color.

6. Sequential Animations

Exercise 16: Create a “loading” text animation that reveals each letter sequentially. Use animation-delay on each letter to create a cascading effect.

Exercise 17: Build a progress bar that fills up from 0% to 100% over 5 seconds. Use keyframes to animate the width of the progress bar.

Exercise 18: Design a list of items that fade in one by one using @keyframes and animation-delay to stagger the appearance of each list item.

7. Infinite Animations and Pausing

Exercise 19: Create a rotating animation for an icon, such as a settings gear, that continuously spins. Use infinite for the animation duration to make it loop indefinitely.

Exercise 20: Make a “scrolling text” effect by animating a text element to move from the right to the left of the screen. Ensure the animation loops infinitely.

Exercise 21: Create a hover animation that plays only while the mouse is over an element. Use animation-play-state: paused and set it to running on hover to start the animation.

8. CSS Animations with Transformations

Exercise 22: Build a flipping card. Use keyframes to rotate the card on the Y-axis when hovered, so it appears to “flip” and show the back side.

Exercise 23: Design a “zoom in” effect for an image. Use keyframes to animate the scale property, making the image start small and grow to full size.

Exercise 24: Create a simple “accordion” menu where each section expands and collapses. Animate the height or max-height property to create a smooth expansion and collapse effect.

9. Animation Timing and Delays

Exercise 25: Build a staggered entrance animation for three boxes. Use animation-delay to delay each box’s animation so they appear one after the other.

Exercise 26: Design a blinking cursor effect using keyframes. Control the timing to make it blink at intervals, similar to a typing cursor.

Exercise 27: Create a typewriter effect using keyframes to display each letter of a sentence one by one. Control the timing to make it look like someone is typing the text.

10. Chaining Transitions and Animations

Exercise 28: Create a card that scales up when hovered. After a brief delay, make an icon inside the card rotate or bounce. Use both transitions and keyframes for this effect.

Exercise 29: Build a button with a “ripple” effect that appears when clicked. Use :active with a keyframe animation to simulate a ripple expanding out from the click point.

Exercise 30: Design a modal window that fades in and scales up when opened, then fades out and scales down when closed. Use transitions for the initial scale and fade effect and keyframes for the closing animation.

11. Advanced Keyframe Animations

Exercise 31: Create a pulsing loading indicator with three dots that move in a wave pattern. Use keyframes to animate each dot with a delay for a wave effect.

Exercise 32: Design a bouncing loader using CSS only. Use @keyframes and animation-delay to make three or more balls bounce in sequence.

Exercise 33: Build a CSS-only fireworks animation using circles and scaling animations. Experiment with keyframes and transform to create bursting and fading effects.

12. Advanced Transition Timing Functions

Exercise 34: Create a “rubber band” effect on a button. When clicked, the button should slightly “stretch” and snap back. Use cubic-bezier() timing functions to simulate the elasticity.

Exercise 35: Build a smooth sliding transition for a sidebar menu that uses ease-in-out timing. Control the speed and easing to make the menu feel natural when opening and closing.

13. Animating SVGs and Icons

Exercise 36: Create a spinning SVG loader icon. Use @keyframes to animate the SVG’s rotation.

Exercise 37: Design a line-drawing effect for an SVG graphic. Use stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset properties to animate the path drawing.

14. Interactive Animations with Hover and Active States

Exercise 38: Build a toggle switch that animates between “On” and “Off” states with a sliding circle. Use transitions for the slide effect and animate color changes to represent the on/off states.

Exercise 39: Create a dropdown menu that appears with a fading and sliding effect when hovered. Use transitions on both the opacity and transform properties.

Exercise 40: Design a notification badge that animates (e.g., bounces or flashes) when a new message is received. Use keyframes to create an attention-grabbing effect.

These exercises cover a wide variety of transition and animation techniques in CSS, offering both fundamental and advanced challenges. They should help solidify your understanding of creating smooth, interactive animations and applying them effectively in a user interface.
