Here are some exercises to help you get hands-on practice with CSS animations and transitions. These exercises progress from basic concepts to more advanced techniques and focus on creating engaging effects that enhance user experience.

### Basic Transitions

- [Exercise 1](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise1/): Create a button that changes color when hovered. Use `transition` to make the color change smoothly over 0.3 seconds.
- [Exercise 2](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise2/): Design a card with a hover effect that increases its size slightly. Add a `transition` to smoothly scale the card over 0.2 seconds.
- [Exercise 3](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise3/): Create a link that underlines itself when hovered. Use `transition` to make the underline appear gradually by animating the text-decoration or by manipulating the width of a pseudo-element.

### Transformations with Transitions

- [Exercise 4](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise4/): Build an image gallery where each image rotates slightly when hovered. Apply `transform: rotate(5deg);` with a `transition` of 0.3 seconds.
- [Exercise 5](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise5/): Create a navigation bar with links that slide upwards when hovered. Use `transform: translateY(-5px);` with a `transition`.
- [Exercise 6](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise6/): Design a 3D button effect. Use `transform: translateZ` or `perspective` to make the button look like it’s pressing down or popping up when hovered, using a `transition` to achieve a smooth effect.

### Hover Effects with Multiple Transitions

- [Exercise 7](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise7/): Create a card with multiple elements (title, image, button). When you hover over the card, make each element transition differently (e.g., the image scales up, the title changes color, and the button moves slightly).
- [Exercise 8](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise8/): Design a profile card that, when hovered, reveals a description by sliding it in from the bottom. Use `transitions` to slide the text smoothly into view.
- [Exercise 9](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise9/): Build a button that changes both its color and background gradient on hover, using `transitions` to create a seamless color and background change.

### Basic Keyframe Animations

- [Exercise 10](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise10/): Create a loading spinner using CSS `@keyframes`. Use `transform: rotate()` to spin a circular element continuously.
- [Exercise 11](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise11/): Design a bouncing ball animation using `@keyframes`. Use `transform: translateY` to move a circle element up and down, simulating a bounce.
- [Exercise 12](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise12/): Create a heartbeat animation using a scale transformation. Animate the scale to simulate a “pulsing” effect on a shape or icon.

### Animating with Color Changes and Opacity

- [Exercise 13](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise13/): Design a fading text effect that fades in and out continuously using `opacity` in `@keyframes`. Animate the opacity from 0 to 1 and back to 0.
- [Exercise 14](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise14/): Create a button that has a glow effect on hover. Use `@keyframes` to change the `box-shadow` to make it look like the glow is pulsing.
- [Exercise 15](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise15/): Design an alert or notification box that flashes twice on page load to grab the user’s attention by animating its background color.

### Sequential Animations

- [Exercise 16](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise16/): Create a “loading” text animation that reveals each letter sequentially. Use `animation-delay` on each letter to create a cascading effect.
- [Exercise 17](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise17/): Build a progress bar that fills up from 0% to 100% over 5 seconds. Use `@keyframes` to animate the width of the progress bar.
- [Exercise 18](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise18/): Design a list of items that fade in one by one using `@keyframes` and `animation-delay` to stagger the appearance of each list item.

### Infinite Animations and Pausing

- [Exercise 19](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise19/): Create a rotating animation for an icon, such as a settings gear, that continuously spins. Use `infinite` for the animation duration to make it loop indefinitely.
- [Exercise 20](../../src/exercises/animations/exercise20/): Make a “scrolling text” effect by animating a text element to move from the right to the left of the screen. Ensure the animation loops infinitely.
