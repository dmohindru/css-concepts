These exercises will give you a solid foundation in typography techniques.

### Font Family and Fallbacks

- [Exercise 1](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise1/): Set up a basic HTML page with a heading, paragraph, and button. Apply a custom font-family stack that includes a web-safe font, a generic fallback (serif, sans-serif, monospace), and a custom Google Font. Test how it looks with different fallback fonts by disconnecting from the internet (to simulate the Google Font not loading).
- [Exercise 2](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise2/): Experiment with multiple font families by setting different font stacks for various HTML elements. Apply a sans-serif font to headings, a serif font to paragraphs, and a monospace font to code snippets.

### Font Size and Responsive Typography

- [Exercise 3](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise3/): Create a basic layout with several headings and paragraphs. Apply different font-size values to each heading level (h1 through h6) and paragraphs. Use relative units like em, rem, %, and vw to see how font sizes adjust based on viewport and element contexts.
- [Exercise 4](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise4/): Design a hero section with a large, eye-catching headline. Make the headline's font size responsive using clamp() to adjust based on screen width, ensuring it scales nicely on both mobile and desktop.

### Font Weight, Style, and Variants

- [Exercise 5](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise5/): Create a sample paragraph with different words styled in different font weights (font-weight: 300, 400, 600, 700, etc.). Observe how font weight affects readability and aesthetics.
- [Exercise 6](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise6/): Apply font-style: italic to a blockquote and experiment with normal, italic, and oblique styles on different elements to create emphasis.

### Line Height and Letter Spacing

- [Exercise 7](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise7/): Set up a paragraph and apply various line-height values (e.g., 1, 1.5, 2) to see how it affects readability and text density. Try different combinations to find an ideal line height for readability.
- [Exercise 8](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise8/): Create a title with wide letter-spacing and narrow letter-spacing to observe how spacing affects visual impact. Try large letter spacing on headings and negative letter spacing on bold text to create distinct effects.

### Text Alignment and Indentation

- [Exercise 9](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise9/): Experiment with different text alignments. Create a paragraph and apply text-align: left, center, right, and justify to see how each alignment affects readability and aesthetics.
- [Exercise 10](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise10/): Create a paragraph with a few sentences and add a text-indent to the first line. Experiment with different text-indent values and combine it with text-align: justify for a magazine-style look.

### Text Decoration and Text Transform

- [Exercise 11](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise11/): Create a navigation menu with several links. Use text-decoration: none to remove the underline from links, then experiment with different decorations like underline, line-through, and overline on hover.
- [Exercise 12](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise12/): Write some button text in lowercase and apply text-transform: uppercase to create a stylistic effect. Experiment with other text-transform values like capitalize and lowercase to see the different visual effects.

### Text Shadow and Advanced Styling

- [Exercise 13](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise13/): Create a headline with a subtle text shadow. Use different text-shadow values to create a 3D effect, experimenting with colors, offsets, and blur radius.
- [Exercise 14](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise14/): Design a “neon glow” effect using text-shadow. Apply multiple shadows in different colors to achieve a glowing or layered effect.

### Web Fonts and Loading Techniques

- [Exercise 15](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise15/): Integrate a Google Font into your page and apply it to your text. Experiment with loading weights and styles (regular, bold, italic) to reduce page load time and improve performance.
- [Exercise 16](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise16/): Use @font-face to load a custom font file locally. Set up fallback fonts and specify various font-weight values for different headings and paragraphs.

### Responsive Typography with Viewport Units

- [Exercise 17](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise17/): Use vw units to create fluid typography. Create a large heading and set its font size using vw, so it scales with the viewport width. Observe the results on different screen sizes.
- [Exercise 18](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise18/): Experiment with clamp() to make a paragraph font-size responsive. Set a minimum and maximum font size that adjusts dynamically within a specified range as the viewport changes.

### Typographic Hierarchy

- [Exercise 19](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise19/): Create a sample webpage with headings, subheadings, and body text. Apply different font sizes, weights, and colors to establish a clear hierarchy and guide the reader's eye through the content.
- [Exercise 20](../../src/exercises/typography/exercise20/): Use different font weights, sizes, and colors to differentiate headings from body text and captions. Experiment with different visual cues to emphasize the most important text.
