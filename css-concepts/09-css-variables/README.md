Here are some exercises to help you practice CSS variables (custom properties). These exercises cover basic usage, responsive adjustments, theming, animations, and more advanced applications of CSS variables.

1. Basic CSS Variables

Exercise 1: Create a variable for primary colors and apply it to headings, paragraphs, and links. Define variables like --primary-color, --secondary-color, and --text-color and use them across the page.

Exercise 2: Set up variables for font sizes (e.g., --font-small, --font-medium, --font-large) and apply them to different text elements. Adjust the variables in a single place to change the font sizes globally.

Exercise 3: Create a card component with CSS variables for padding and margin (e.g., --card-padding, --card-margin). Use the variables to control spacing around and inside the card.

2. Color Themes with CSS Variables

Exercise 4: Create a light and dark theme using CSS variables for background and text colors. Set variables like --background-color and --text-color, and switch their values when applying a dark-theme class to the body.

Exercise 5: Implement a color scheme for a website header, navigation, and footer using CSS variables. Use variables for --header-background, --nav-color, --footer-background, and apply them consistently across those elements.

Exercise 6: Make a theme toggle button that switches between two themes (e.g., light and dark) by toggling CSS variables. Create variables for both themes and use JavaScript to toggle classes that change the variable values.

3. Responsive Design with CSS Variables

Exercise 7: Define variables for breakpoints (e.g., --small-screen, --medium-screen, --large-screen) and use them in media queries to change layout and styles based on screen size.

Exercise 8: Set up responsive typography using CSS variables. Define variables like --font-size-small, --font-size-medium, and --font-size-large and apply them based on screen size.

Exercise 9: Create a responsive grid layout where the number of columns is controlled by a variable (--num-columns). Change the value of --num-columns in media queries to adjust the grid for different screen sizes.

4. Using Variables in Animations and Transitions

Exercise 10: Set up CSS variables for animation duration and timing function (e.g., --animation-duration, --timing-function). Apply them to a button hover effect and change the values to see different animation styles.

Exercise 11: Create a loading spinner using CSS variables to control the animation speed (e.g., --spinner-speed). Adjust the speed dynamically by changing the variable’s value.

Exercise 12: Define variables for different transform values (e.g., --scale-factor, --rotate-angle) and apply them in an animation. Change the variable values to see the transform effect adjust smoothly.

5. Applying Variables for Spacing and Layout Control

Exercise 13: Set up a CSS variable for spacing (e.g., --spacing-unit) and use it for padding and margin on various elements like headers, buttons, and cards. Adjust the spacing unit in one place to see changes across all elements.

Exercise 14: Define CSS variables for common layout measurements like --max-width and --container-padding and apply them to control the layout of a page. Change the variables to see how they affect the layout.

Exercise 15: Create a CSS variable for the gutter width (e.g., --gutter-width) in a grid layout. Use it to set gaps between columns and rows, and adjust the gutter width by changing the variable’s value.

6. Dynamic Color Adjustments Using HSL

Exercise 16: Use HSL values in CSS variables to define primary colors (e.g., --primary-hue, --primary-saturation, --primary-lightness). Adjust just the hue value to create color variations across the page.

Exercise 17: Make a hover effect on a button that lightens the background color. Use CSS variables for HSL lightness values (e.g., --button-lightness) and adjust it on hover.

Exercise 18: Create a theme where the hue of the primary color changes dynamically based on user interaction. For example, use JavaScript to adjust --primary-hue when a button is clicked, creating a color-shift effect.

7. Variables in Nested Components

Exercise 19: Create a card component with a title, description, and button, using separate variables for each part (e.g., --card-title-color, --card-bg-color, --card-button-color). Customize each card component by changing the variable values for specific cards.

Exercise 20: Define variables for a navbar (e.g., --nav-background, --nav-link-color). Override these variables locally in specific sections of the page to customize the navbar appearance based on the section.

Exercise 21: Set up a sidebar that uses CSS variables for width (e.g., --sidebar-width). Change the width based on screen size or user interaction to practice dynamic layouts.

8. Advanced Themable Components

Exercise 22: Design a form with CSS variables for border, focus, and hover states for inputs and buttons (e.g., --input-border-color, --input-focus-color). Change the values to create light and dark themed versions of the form.

Exercise 23: Create a card component that uses CSS variables for border-radius, shadow, and spacing. Adjust these variables to create a “compact” and “spacious” version of the card.

Exercise 24: Design a multi-step form where each step has a different theme color. Use CSS variables to set a color scheme for each step, making use of --step-background and --step-text-color variables.

9. Interactive Components with Variables

Exercise 25: Create a progress bar with a CSS variable for the progress percentage (e.g., --progress-percent). Use JavaScript to dynamically update the percentage by changing the variable’s value.

Exercise 26: Make a color picker that changes the background color of a preview box based on a user-selected color. Set the background color using a CSS variable (--preview-color) and update it through JavaScript.

Exercise 27: Design a button with CSS variables that dynamically change its background color, shadow, and size based on hover, active, and focus states.

10. Practice with Root Variables and Overrides

Exercise 28: Set up global root-level variables for common colors, typography, and spacing in :root. Use them across various components on the page for consistent styling.

Exercise 29: Create multiple containers (e.g., container-a, container-b) and override root variables within each container. Apply different theme styles by setting different values for each container.

Exercise 30: Define global padding and margin variables in :root, and use them across different sections of the webpage. Adjust the global values to see how it affects layout and spacing across the entire site.

11. Variables for Animation Timing and Control

Exercise 31: Create a keyframe animation for an element to fade in and out, controlled by a CSS variable for timing (e.g., --fade-duration). Adjust the variable to control the speed of the fade.

Exercise 32: Design a bouncing ball animation where the height of each bounce is controlled by a CSS variable (--bounce-height). Change the variable dynamically to control the bounce height.

Exercise 33: Set up a CSS variable for transition timing (e.g., --transition-time) and apply it to various hover effects on buttons and links across the page. Adjust the variable to control the transition speed consistently.

12. Combining Variables with JavaScript

Exercise 34: Create a theme switcher that updates CSS variables (e.g., --background-color, --text-color) based on user selection. Use JavaScript to change the variable values dynamically.

Exercise 35: Implement a font-size slider where changing the slider value updates a CSS variable (--base-font-size) and scales the font size across the page.

Exercise 36: Build an interactive product card with a color picker that changes the background color of the card by updating a CSS variable (--card-bg-color) using JavaScript.

These exercises will help you understand and become proficient with CSS variables, allowing you to build dynamic, themeable, and reusable CSS for any project. Let me know if you'd like more guidance on any of these exercises!
