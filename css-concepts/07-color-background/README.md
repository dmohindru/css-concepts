Here are exercises to help you practice CSS concepts for colors and backgrounds, covering gradients, images, overlays, and blending. These exercises will give you a solid understanding of how to create visually appealing and functional designs.

### Basic Color and Background Color

- [Exercise 1](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise1/): Create a webpage with different sections, each with a unique background color. Use different color values, such as hex codes, RGB, and named colors.
- [Exercise 2](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise2/): Design a card with a specific background color. Add a hover effect that changes the background color smoothly using `transition`.
- [Exercise 3](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise3/): Create a list of items, each with a slightly different shade of a color. Experiment with `rgba()` for colors with transparency to add a translucent effect to the list.

### Linear and Radial Gradients

- [Exercise 4](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise4/): Create a button with a linear gradient background. Make the gradient transition from one color to another on hover.
- [Exercise 5](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise5/): Design a hero section with a radial gradient background. Center the gradient and use different colors to create a subtle, soft background effect.
- [Exercise 6](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise6/): Create a striped pattern using linear gradients by combining multiple color stops. Use `repeating-linear-gradient` to make a repeating pattern that looks like stripes.

### Background Images

- [Exercise 7](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise7/): Set a background image for a webpage and practice with properties like `background-size`, `background-position`, and `background-repeat` to see how they affect the image’s display.
- [Exercise 8](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise8/): Create a profile card with a background image. Experiment with `background-position` to adjust how the image appears in different-sized cards.
- [Exercise 9](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise9/): Design a webpage section with a background image that covers the full viewport (`background-size: cover`) and stays fixed when scrolling (`background-attachment: fixed`).

### Background Image Overlays

- [Exercise 10](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise10/): Create a card with a background image and add a semi-transparent overlay on top to make the text more readable. Use `rgba()` for the overlay color.
- [Exercise 11](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise11/): Design a hero banner with a background image and a gradient overlay that fades from transparent to solid color at the bottom. Use `linear-gradient` with the `background-image` property.
- [Exercise 12](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise12/): Build a call-to-action section with a full-width background image and add a color overlay that changes on hover, providing a slight color accent.

### CSS Background Blend Modes

- [Exercise 13](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise13/): Create a hero section with a background image and a solid color overlay using `background-blend-mode`. Experiment with blend modes like `multiply`, `overlay`, and `screen` to see how they interact with the image.
- [Exercise 14](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise14/): Design a card with a background gradient and an image. Apply different blend modes to achieve unique visual effects, making the card background more interesting.
- [Exercise 15](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise15/): Make a gallery of images with a semi-transparent overlay color using `background-blend-mode` on hover. Try modes like `difference` or `hard-light` to create dynamic visual effects.

### Gradient Text Effects

- [Exercise 16](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise16/): Create a heading with a gradient applied to the text using `background-clip: text` and `color: transparent`. Experiment with different gradients to see how it affects the text’s appearance.
- [Exercise 17](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise17/): Design a button with a gradient text effect that changes direction on hover. Use `linear-gradient` and `background-clip: text` to achieve this.

### Complex Background Combinations

- [Exercise 18](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise18/): Create a card that combines a gradient, a background color, and a background image. Control each layer’s opacity, blend mode, and positioning to achieve a multi-layered effect.
- [Exercise 19](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise19/): Design a banner with a background pattern, an image overlay, and a solid color overlay. Use a mix of `background-image`, `background-color`, and `background-blend-mode` to control the effect.
- [Exercise 20](../../src/exercises/backgrounds/exercise20/): Create a webpage with different sections, each having complex background combinations of images, gradients, and patterns. Try various `background-blend-mode` options to achieve unique effects for each section.
