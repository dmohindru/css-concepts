Mastering layout techniques is key to building responsive and well-structured designs. Here are some exercises that cover various layout techniques using CSS:

1. Flexbox Layout
   Exercise 1: Create a navigation bar with a logo on the left and navigation links on the right. Use display: flex to align items horizontally and justify-content: space-between to spread them out.
   Exercise 2: Make a responsive photo gallery using Flexbox. Create a grid of images that wrap onto multiple rows. Set flex-wrap: wrap and use justify-content: center to keep the gallery centered.
   Exercise 3: Build a "card" layout where each card has a title, an image, and a description. Use Flexbox to center the text vertically inside the card and align it with the image.
   Exercise 4: Create a multi-column layout with three boxes aligned horizontally. Set one box to grow (flex-grow: 1) while the others have a fixed width.
   Exercise 5: Make a responsive footer with three sections (e.g., contact info, links, social media). Use Flexbox to display them in a single row on large screens and stack them vertically on small screens.

2. Grid Layout
   Exercise 6: Create a 3x3 grid layout for a tic-tac-toe board. Use CSS Grid to make each cell equal-sized and center-aligned.
   Exercise 7: Build a basic dashboard with a header, sidebar, main content area, and footer. Use Grid to divide the layout into sections, with the sidebar taking up a single column and the main content area spanning multiple columns.
   Exercise 8: Make a responsive grid of "cards" where each row displays three cards on larger screens and one card on small screens. Use media queries with Grid's grid-template-columns to adjust the number of columns.
   Exercise 9: Create a simple pricing table with three pricing tiers. Use CSS Grid to arrange each tier's features vertically, then make each tier align in a single row at the top level.
   Exercise 10: Build a magazine-style layout with a large featured article and several smaller articles around it. Use Grid areas to place elements precisely.

3. Positioning (Relative, Absolute, Fixed, and Sticky)
   Exercise 11: Create a sidebar that sticks to the side of the viewport as the user scrolls. Use position: sticky to keep it visible within the scrolling section.
   Exercise 12: Make a banner that stays fixed at the top of the page as the user scrolls. Use position: fixed and set a high z-index to ensure it stays above other content.
   Exercise 13: Place an icon in the bottom-right corner of a card using position: absolute. Make sure the card container has position: relative so the icon is positioned relative to the card.
   Exercise 14: Build a "tooltip" effect. When the user hovers over a button, display a small box (the tooltip) with additional information above the button. Use position: absolute for the tooltip.
   Exercise 15: Design a sticky header that appears once the user scrolls past the initial page content. Use JavaScript to toggle position: sticky or position: fixed based on the scroll position.

4. Responsive Design
   Exercise 16: Create a responsive navigation menu that changes from a horizontal layout to a vertical layout on smaller screens. Use Flexbox or Grid along with media queries to adjust the layout based on screen width.
   Exercise 17: Design a simple, two-column layout (content and sidebar). On larger screens, display the sidebar next to the content; on smaller screens, stack the sidebar below the content.
   Exercise 18: Make a responsive image grid that automatically changes the number of columns based on screen size. Use CSS Grid’s auto-fill or auto-fit properties with minmax.
   Exercise 19: Create a flexible hero section with a large background image, text overlay, and a call-to-action button. Use vw, vh, and media queries to make it look good on various screen sizes.
   Exercise 20: Build a responsive form layout. Place labels and inputs side-by-side on large screens and stack them vertically on smaller screens.

5. Multi-column Layout
   Exercise 21: Use the CSS columns property to create a multi-column text layout, such as a newspaper-style article. Experiment with column-count and column-gap for styling.
   Exercise 22: Create a simple layout for displaying reviews in a two-column format, where the text wraps into two columns. Use column-width to control column behavior on different screen sizes.
   Exercise 23: Design a layout with three columns for desktop screens and switch to a single-column layout on mobile. Use media queries to adjust column-count based on screen width.

6. Float Layout
   Exercise 24: Create a "card" with an image floated to the left of some text. Use the float property to wrap the text around the image and add padding for separation.
   Exercise 25: Build a three-column layout using floats. Float each column to the left, and use a clearfix technique to prevent container collapse.
   Exercise 26: Create a basic product listing with images floated beside each description. Add padding and margins to ensure each item has enough space.

7. Media Queries
   Exercise 27: Make a responsive layout that changes background colors at various breakpoints (e.g., one color for mobile, another for tablets, and another for desktops).
   Exercise 28: Create a navigation bar that changes style based on screen width. On smaller screens, hide certain items or switch to a “hamburger” menu icon.
   Exercise 29: Build a layout that changes font sizes at different breakpoints. Use media queries to make the text more readable on smaller screens.
   Exercise 30: Create a simple three-column layout on desktop screens that switches to a single column on mobile using media queries.
