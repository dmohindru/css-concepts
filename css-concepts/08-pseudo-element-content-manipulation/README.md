Here are some exercises to help you practice CSS pseudo-elements and content manipulation using `::before` and `::after`. These exercises cover content insertion, decorative elements, custom styles for links and buttons, and more.

### Basic Pseudo-elements Usage

- [Exercise 1](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise1/): Add a decorative icon to a heading using `::before`. Use `content` to display a symbol or Unicode character before the heading text.
- [Exercise 2](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise2/): Create a navigation menu where each link has a custom arrow symbol at the end using `::after`. Style it so that the arrows only appear on hover.
- [Exercise 3](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise3/): Add a small line or divider before and after a section title using `::before` and `::after`. Experiment with different widths and colors to make it look like a styled header.

### Adding Quotes and Decorative Content

- [Exercise 4](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise4/): Create a blockquote element and add decorative quotation marks around it using `::before` and `::after`. Customize the quotation marks' color, size, and position.
- [Exercise 5](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise5/): Design a testimonial section with each testimonial inside a card. Use `::before` and `::after` to add quotation marks around each testimonial to give it a polished look.

### Buttons with Pseudo-elements

- [Exercise 6](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise6/): Create a button with an animated underline using `::before` or `::after`. Make the underline appear only when the button is hovered.
- [Exercise 7](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise7/): Design a button with an arrow icon using `::after`. When the user hovers, animate the arrow to move slightly to the right.
- [Exercise 8](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise8/): Create a button with a double border effect using `::before` and `::after`. Use absolute positioning to place the borders outside the button’s main area.

### Content Manipulation with Counters

- [Exercise 9](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise9/): Create a list of steps (e.g., Step 1, Step 2, etc.) where each list item automatically gets a step number using CSS counters and `::before`.
- [Exercise 10](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise10/): Create a gallery of images. Use `::after` to add a “View More” label that appears only when the image is hovered.

### Hover Effects with Pseudo-elements

- [Exercise 11](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise11/): Create a card that has a “Read More” overlay with `::after`. Make it appear when the card is hovered.
- [Exercise 12](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise12/): Add a subtle shadow effect to an image using `::before`. When the image is hovered, animate the shadow to make it look like the image is lifting.
- [Exercise 13](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise13/): Make a link with an underline that grows in width when hovered. Use `::after` to create the underline and animate it.

### Creating Badges and Labels

- [Exercise 14](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise14/): Create a “New” badge on a product card using `::before` or `::after`. Position the badge in the top-right corner of the card and style it as a small, rounded label.
- [Exercise 15](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise15/): Design a list of items where each item has a "hot" label next to it. Use `::after` to add the label, and make it only visible on specific items.

### Decorative Lines and Borders

- [Exercise 16](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise16/): Create a title with a line on each side using `::before` and `::after`. Center the title and make the lines the same length on either side.
- [Exercise 17](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise17/): Design a divider line with a small circle in the middle using `::before` and `::after`. Style the divider to appear between different sections of your content.

### Custom Link Styles

- [Exercise 18](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise18/): Create a link that has a decorative effect on hover using `::before` and `::after`. For example, make two diagonal lines that cross behind the link text when hovered.
- [Exercise 19](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise19/): Design a link with a background color that slides in from the left using `::before`. Use transitions to make the effect smooth on hover.

### Highlighting and Masking Text

- [Exercise 20](../../src/exercises/pseudo/exercise20/): Create a heading with a background highlight that extends on hover. Use `::before` to add a color overlay that animates across the heading text.
