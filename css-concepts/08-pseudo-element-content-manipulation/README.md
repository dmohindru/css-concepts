Here are some exercises to help you practice CSS pseudo-elements and content manipulation using ::before and ::after. These exercises cover content insertion, decorative elements, custom styles for links and buttons, and more.

1. Basic Pseudo-elements Usage

Exercise 1: Add a decorative icon to a heading using ::before. Use content to display a symbol or Unicode character before the heading text.

Exercise 2: Create a navigation menu where each link has a custom arrow symbol at the end using ::after. Style it so that the arrows only appear on hover.

2. Adding Quotes and Decorative Content

Exercise 4: Create a blockquote element and add decorative quotation marks around it using ::before and ::after. Customize the quotation marks' color, size, and position.

Exercise 5: Design a testimonial section with each testimonial inside a card. Use ::before and ::after to add quotation marks around each testimonial to give it a polished look.

Exercise 6: Make a "note" section on a webpage where each paragraph has a small "Note:" label added at the beginning with ::before. Style it with a different color and font weight.

3. Buttons with Pseudo-elements

Exercise 7: Create a button with an animated underline using ::before or ::after. Make the underline appear only when the button is hovered.

Exercise 8: Design a button with an arrow icon using ::after. When the user hovers, animate the arrow to move slightly to the right.

Exercise 14: Add a subtle shadow effect to an image using ::before. When the image is hovered, animate the shadow to make it look like the image is lifting.

Exercise 28: Create a button with a loading spinner that appears when the button is clicked. Use ::after for the spinner and add an animation to make it rotate.

Exercise 29: Design a progress bar that fills up using ::before. Make it responsive so it fills the bar width as the progress value increases.

Exercise 36: Create a search input with a magnifying glass icon on the left using ::before. Style it to look like an embedded icon in the input.

13. Complex Decorative Elements

Exercise 37: Design a button with a trailing animated shadow using ::after. Make the shadow follow the button slightly when it’s hovered.

Exercise 38: Create a star rating system where each star fills with color on hover. Use ::before and ::after for each star and apply transitions for a smooth fill effect.
